# How to take care of a pet
## Step one : get a pet
You can buy your pet at many different stores like Pet Smart or Petco. But first, you have to decide what type of pet you want. 
A bird, cat, dog, fish, hamster, and reptiles are all different types of pets avaliable. Each one of these pets require different types of care and attention so make sure to choose one that you can properly take care of. One way to narrow down your choices, is the amount of free time you have. If you have little to no free time, a fish is the best choice. However, if you have a lot of free time a dog is the best choice.
